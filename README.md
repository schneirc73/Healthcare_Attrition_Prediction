# Healthcare_Attrition_Prediction

The purpose of this project is to create a classifier that can accuratly predicit if a healthcare employee has left their current job.  This is a useful idea as a threshold tool hopstials or clinics can use to determine if their current employees are similar to employees that have left in the past. By using this method they can find employees that are on the verge of leaving and adjust varaibles to keep them at the current position or start the process of finding somebody to fill the potential vacancy.  By having a better understanding of the workforce threshold a hospital/clinic can maintain a full staff with fewer suprises. 

The data used to create the classifier is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpmiller/employee-attrition-for-healthcare?select=watson_healthcare_modified.csv
